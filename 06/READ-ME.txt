This is my submission for project 6 (Assembler) in JAVA.
To run, simple copy the .asm files from the 06 folders into the main folder 
where the .java files are. Then run the code:
 
>javac *.java
>java Assembler Pong
>Done (This outputs the .hack file)

The process should run quickly and output a .hack file.
